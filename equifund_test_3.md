// Briefly describe your workflow when you create a web page?

1. The whole process usually includes asking opinions of the product owner, manager, colleagues,
  friends what they would like / be comfortable with on the webpage.
2. Create a mini-user story, what the page should have in terms of functionality
3. Think of separate block elements (header, footer, body elements, sidebar(s))
4. Draw a mock up on a paper or using https://www.draw.io/
  Initial design starts on this step. Of course the design / mock up should not contradict
  the entire website's logic, UI and UX
5. Pick up technologies/frameworks/libraries
6. Write the tests (if necessary) and code and see how it works
7. If everything works as expected, improve design by adding CSS and iprove UX
8. Getting feedback and suggestions from other people
9. Make improvements and changes, if necessary
