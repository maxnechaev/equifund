What are some strategies you would use to write efficient CSS?

1. Keeping in mind that CSS (as well as the remaining code) should be DRY.
2. If I use React or Angular, I usually have a separate css file for each component (Angular CLI generates it for you). That helps to maintain and debug code in a more efficient way.
3. Avoid nesting
4. Avoid using inline styling (only when it is completely necessary)
5. Avoid using !important
