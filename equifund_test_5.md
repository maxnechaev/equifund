State your preferred HTML/CSS/JS framework, your experience with it,
and some benefits and drawbacks of the framework?


Bootstrap
it is the most popular framework when it comes to responsive design. Of corse there are analogues such as Zurb and others, but Bootstrap is the most developed and least buggy among all of them. I used BS in almost every project that I was involved in. There is an adaptation of BS called react-bootstrap that I used in design of React projects  

Material UI and Semantic UI
Putting them together, because their value and use are very comparable to each other. I usually choose one over another depending on the task. They help to implement more sophisticated design features in comparison to bootstrap.

React
Very fast and comparatively simple framework that helps to create modern web apps and write reusable components that greatly  save time. One direction data flow - from parent to child component.

Angular CLI (6+)
Similar to React in terms of reusability. More complicated than React and has two directions data flow.
