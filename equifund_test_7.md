What is a Child Theme and why are they used?


Child Theme is a modification of the main (parent) theme in Wordpress. It wholly or partially takes functionality and design of the Parent and/or modifies them in a certain way. This helps to do few things:
a) maintain the Parent Theme untouched
b) customize the Theme to tailor the project's objectives and design
—Å) debug in a more efficient manner
